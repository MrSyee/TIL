In unity, our spirits blend,
A crew of souls, until the end.
Through stormy seas or skies so bright,
We stand as one, a guiding light.

With tasks to do and goals to meet,
Our skills combine, a victory sweet.
No challenge vast, no mountain high,
Can break the bond that makes us fly.

In every task, we find our worth,
A tapestry of strength on Earth.
So let us sail, with hearts ablaze,
A crew united, through all our days.
